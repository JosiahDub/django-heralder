A Django messaging library that features:

- Class-based declaration and registry approach, like Django Admin
- Supports multiple transmission methods (Email, SMS, Slack, etc) per message
- Browser-based previewing of messages
- Maintains a history of messaging sending attempts and can view these messages
- Disabling notifications per user
- Auto conversion of HTML emails to text versions

# History

Django-Heralder is a fork of the legacy [Django-Herald](https://github.com/worthwhile/django-herald).

The v0.3.0 release of Django-Herald has the same features and is equal to Django-Heralder v0.3.0.
Releases of Django-Heralder after v0.3.0 will diverge with new features and bug fixes.

# Python/Django Support

We try to make herald support all versions of django that django supports + all versions in between. 

For python, herald supports all versions of python that the above versions of django support.

So as of herald v0.3 we support django 3.2 and 4.x+, and python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

# Installation

1. `pip install django-heralder`
2. Add `herald` and `django.contrib.sites` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
3. Add herald's URLS:

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls import url, include

urlpatterns = []

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^herald/', include('herald.urls')),
   ] + urlpatterns
```

# Usage

1. Create a `notifications.py` file in any django app. This is where your notification classes will live. Add a class like this:

```python
from herald import registry
from herald.base import EmailNotification


class WelcomeEmail(EmailNotification):  # extend from EmailNotification for emails
    template_name = 'welcome_email'  # name of template, without extension
    subject = 'Welcome'  # subject of email

    def __init__(self, user):  # optionally customize the initialization
        self.context = {'user': user}  # set context for the template rendering
        self.to_emails = [user.email]  # set list of emails to send to

    @staticmethod
    def get_demo_args():  # define a static method to return list of args needed to initialize class for testing
        from users.models import User
        return [User.objects.order_by('?')[0]]

registry.register(WelcomeEmail)  # finally, register your notification class

# Alternatively, a class decorator can be used to register the notification:

@registry.register_decorator()
class WelcomeEmail(EmailNotification):
    ...
```


2. Create templates for rendering the email using this file structure:

        templates/
            herald/
                text/
                    welcome_email.txt
                html/
                    welcome_email.html

3. Test how your email looks by navigating to `/herald/`.

4. Send your email wherever you need in your code:

        WelcomeEmail(user).send()

5. View the sent emails in django admin and even be able to resend it.

## Advanced templatename options

There's three different ways to specify `templatename`:

1. a string without any slash, e.g. `"welcome_email"` and Herald will expect

        templates/
            herald/
                text/
                    welcome_email.txt
                html/
                    welcome_email.html

2. a string with slashes, e.g. `"path/to/welcome_email"` and Herald will expect

        templates/
            path/
                to/
                    welcome_email.txt
                    welcome_email.html

3. a dict e.g.
```
{
    "text": "path/to/welcome_email_t.txt",
    "html": "path/to/welcome_email_h.html"
}
```
and Herald will expect

        templates/
            path/
                to/
                    welcome_email_t.txt
                    welcome_email_h.html


## Email options

The following options can be set on the email notification class. For Example:

```
class WelcomeEmail(EmailNotification):
    cc = ['test@example.com']
```

- `from_email`: (`str`, default: `settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`) email address of sender
- `subject`: (`str`, default: ) email subject
- `to_emails`: (`List[str]`, default: `None`) list of email strings to send to
- `bcc`: (`List[str]`, default: `None`) list of email strings to send as bcc
- `cc`: (`List[str]`, default: `None`) list of email strings to send as cc
- `headers`: (`dict`, default: `None`) extra headers to be passed along to the `EmailMultiAlternatives` object
- `reply_to`: (`List[str]`, default: `None`) list of email strings to send as the Reply-To emails
- `attachments`: (`list`) list of attachments. See "Email Attachments" below for more info

## Automatically Deleting Old Notifications

Herald can automatically delete old notifications whenever a new notification is sent.

To enable this, set the `HERALD_NOTIFICATION_RETENTION_TIME` setting to a timedelta instance.

For example:

```
HERALD_NOTIFICATION_RETENTION_TIME = timedelta(weeks=8)
```

Will delete all notifications older than 8 weeks every time a new notification is sent.

## Manually Deleting Old Notifications

The `delnotifs` command is useful for purging the notification history.

The default usage will delete everything from sent during today:

```bash
python manage.py delnotifs
```

However, you can also pass arguments for `start` or `end` dates. `end` is up to, but not including that date.
- if only `end` is specified, delete anything sent before the end date.
- if only `start` is specified, delete anything sent since the start date.
- if both `start` and `end` are specified, delete anything sent in between, not including the end date.

```bash
python manage.py delnotifs --start='2016-01-01' --end='2016-01-10'
```

## Asynchronous Email Sending

If you are sending slightly different emails to a large number of people, it might take quite a while to process. By default, Django will process this all synchronously. For asynchronous support, we recommend django-celery-email. It is very straightfoward to setup and integrate: https://github.com/pmclanahan/django-celery-email

## herald.contrib.auth

Django has built-in support for sending password reset emails. If you would like to send those emails using herald, you can use the notification class in herald.contrib.auth.

First, add `herald.contrib.auth` to `INSTALLED_APPS` (in addition to `herald`).

Second, use the `HeraldPasswordResetForm` in place of django's built in `PasswordResetForm`. This step is entirely dependant on your project structure, but it essentially just involves changing the form class on the password reset view in some way:

```python
# you may simply just need to override the password reset url like so:
url(r'^password_reset/$', password_reset, name='password_reset', {'password_reset_form': HeraldPasswordResetForm}),

# of if you are using something like django-authtools:
url(r'^password_reset/$', PasswordResetView.as_view(form_class=HeraldPasswordResetForm), name='password_reset'),

# or you may have a customized version of the password reset view:
class MyPasswordResetView(FormView):
    form_class = HeraldPasswordResetForm  # change the form class here

# or, you may have a custom password reset form already. In that case, you will want to extend from the HeraldPasswordResetForm:
class MyPasswordResetForm(HeraldPasswordResetForm):
    ...

# alternatively, you could even just send the notification wherever you wish, seperate from the form:
PasswordResetEmail(some_user).send()
```

Third, you may want to customize the templates for the email. By default, herald will use the `registration/password_reset_email.html` that is provided by django for both the html and text versions of the email. But you can simply override `herald/html/password_reset.html` and/or `herald/text/password_reset.txt` to suit your needs.

## User Disabled Notifications

If you want to disable certain notifications per user, add a record to the UserNotification table and
add notifications to the disabled_notifications many to many table.

For example:

```python
user = User.objects.get(id=user.id)

notification = Notification.objects.get(notification_class=MyNotification.get_class_path())

# disable the notification
user.usernotification.disabled_notifications.add(notification)
```

By default, notifications can be disabled.  You can put can_disable = False in your notification class and the system will
populate the database with this default.  Your Notification class can also override the verbose_name by setting it in your
inherited Notification class.  Like this:

```python
class MyNotification(EmailNotification):
    can_disable = False
    verbose_name = "My Required Notification"
```

## Email Attachments

To send attachments, assign a list of attachments to the attachments attribute of your EmailNotification instance, or override the get_attachments() method.

Each attachment in the list can be one of the following:

1. A tuple which consists of the filename, the raw attachment data, and the mimetype. It is up to you to get the attachment data. Like this:

```python
raw_data = get_pdf_data()

email.attachments = [
    ('Report.pdf', raw_data, 'application/pdf'),
    ('report.txt', 'text version of report', 'text/plain')
]
email.send()
```

2. A MIMEBase object. See the documentation for attachments under EmailMessage Objects/attachments in the Django documentation.

3. A django `File` object.

### Inline Attachments

Sometimes you want to embed an image directly into the email content.  Do that by using a MIMEImage assigning a content id header to a MIMEImage, like this:

```python
email = WelcomeEmail(user)
im = get_thumbnail(image_file.name, '600x600', quality=95)
my_image = MIMEImage(im.read()) # MIMEImage inherits from MIMEBase
my_image.add_header('Content-ID', '<{}>'.format(image_file.name))
```

You can refer to these images in your html email templates using the Content ID (cid) like this:

```html
<img src="cid:{{image_file.name}}" />
```

You would of course need to add the "image_file" to your template context in the example above.  You can also accomplish this using file operations.  In this example we overrode the get_attachments method of an EmailNotification.

```python
class MyNotification(EmailNotification):
    context = {'hello': 'world'}
    template_name = 'welcome_email'
    to_emails = ['somebody@example.com']
    subject = "My email test"
        
    def get_attachments(self):
        fp = open('python.jpeg', 'rb')
        img = MIMEImage(fp.read())
        img.add_header('Content-ID', '<{}>'.format('python.jpeg'))
        return [
            img,
        ]
```

And in your template you would refer to it like this, and you would not need to add anything to the context:

```html
    <img src="cid:python.jpeg" />
```

### HTML2Text Support

Django Herald can auto convert your HTML emails to plain text.  Any email without a plain text version
will be auto converted if you enable this feature.

```
# Install html2text
pip install django-heralder[html2text]
```

In your settings.py file:

```
HERALD_HTML2TEXT_ENABLED = True
```

You can customize the output of HTML2Text by setting a configuration dictionary. See 
[HTML2Text Configuration](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text/blob/master/docs/usage.md) for options

```
HERALD_HTML2TEXT_CONFIG = {
    # Key / value configuration of html2text 
    'ignore_images': True  # Ignores images in conversion
}
```

```
HERALD_RAISE_MISSING_TEMPLATES = True
```

By default, Herald will raise an exception if a template is missing when true (default).

### Twilio

```
# Install twilio
pip install django-heralder[twilio]
```

You can retrieve these values on [Twilio Console](https://twilio.com/console). Once you have retrieve the necessary ids, you can place those to your `settings.py`.

For reference, Twilio has some great tutorials for python.
[Twilio Python Tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python)

```
# Twilio configurations
# values taken from `twilio console`
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = "your_account_sid"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_auth_token"
TWILIO_DEFAULT_FROM_NUMBER = "+1234567890"

```

### Other MIME attachments

You can also attach any MIMEBase objects as regular attachments, but you must add a content-disposition header, or they will be inaccessible:  

```python
my_image.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="python.jpg"')
```

Attachments can cause your database to become quite large, so you should be sure to run the management commands to purge the database of old messages.
